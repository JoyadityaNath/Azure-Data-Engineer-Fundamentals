IAAS(Infrastructure as a Service): Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a business model that delivers IT infrastructure like compute, storage, and network resources on a pay-as-you-go basis over the internet. 
                                   You are responsible for deploying, maintaining, and supporting your applications, and the IaaS provider is responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure.


PAAS(Platform as a Service): In the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model, developers essentially rent everything they need to build an application, relying on a cloud provider for development tools, infrastructure, 
and operating systems. This is one of the three service models of cloud computing. PaaS vastly simplifies web application development; from the developer's perspective, all backend management takes place behind 
the scenes. Although PaaS has some similarities with serverless computing, there are many critical differences between them.


SAAS(Software as a Service): Software as a service is a cloud computing service model in which a provider delivers application software to clients while managing the required physical and software resources.
